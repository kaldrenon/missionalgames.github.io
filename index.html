              <p>The Missional Gaming community is an organization with one dream: to share the love of Jesus with gamers through gaming.</p>
              <p>MGC was founded by InterVarsity Staff, and we share InterVarsity’s core beliefs. MGG aims to mirror InterVarsity’s collegiate ministries in gaming communities, online and offline, and we have adapted their means of formation and expression into a digital setting.</p>
              <p>MGC exists primarily as a Discord community, where we gather for all of our core functions:</p>

              <p>Every good adventure has quests, and the adventure of gaming missionally is no exception. Quests provide specific objectives that help focus us; by laying out some parameters, we can turn the enormous, daunting world of online gaming into smaller segments that we have the ability to embrace.</p>
              <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
              <p>In InterVarsity’s Missional Gaming community, we take on a new quest every month, and meet together weekly to reflect and discuss the experience. Quests challenge us to be missional in specific ways, by reaching out to people we might usually overlook, playing games we don’t regularly play, or participating in gaming spaces (like Discord servers, subreddits, and Facebook groups) in a more intentional way.</p>
              <p>Each quest is designed to leave a lot of freedom so that anyone can find a way to participate, but also to lead us toward more meaningful, valuable connections with the people we meet.</p>
              <p>Questing has two forms: Short quests, and Story Mode. Short quests are short-term (one week or one month) prompts that challenge us to think about our impact on our gaming spaces in unique and provocative ways. Story Mode is how we commit intentionally to long-term relationships in specific gaming spaces.</p>

          <p><a href="http://discord.gg">Discord</a> is a text, voice, and video chat platform that was designed with gamers in mind, and has become the
            ideal platform for gamers to meet, socialize, and play together!</p>
          <p>InterVarsity’s Missional Gaming server is our hub for talking together, supporting each other, <a href="#questing">questing</a>, and discussing the experience of sharing the Gospel with other gamers.</p>
          <p>Everyone is welcome to join us! You do not need to be a Christian to join the server, however we will often talk matter-of-factly about our faith and our desire to share that with others, and the purpose of the server is to encourage sharing the gospel. If that sounds good to you, come say hi! If you’re looking for a chill place to just have fun and play games, check out Gamechurch.</p>
